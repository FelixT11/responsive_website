        <p>Placeholder text.....Alfred Ezra was born in India in 1872 to a Jewish family and was privately educated in Calcutta. His father was Elias David Ezra and his mother was Mozelle Sassoon. His brother David maintained a private zoo in Calcutta.[1]

He moved to England in 1912. During World War I he served with Indian troops in Europe, and was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his efforts.[1]

Ezra acquired Foxwarren Park in Surrey in 1919. There he assembled a private collection of rare birds which was considered the finest of its kind before the World War II, when the estate was commandeered for war work. He was President of the Avicultural Society and a prominent member of the Zoological Society of London, which awarded him a gold medal. He also wrote articles for Avicultural Magazine and other journals.[1]</p>

        <h3>Konzept</h3>
    
        <p>Placeholder text.....The state flag of Washington consists of the state seal, displaying an image of state namesake George Washington, on a field of dark green with gold fringe being optional. It is the only U.S. state flag with a field of green as well as the only state flag with the image of an American president. The Secretary of State regulates flag protocol related to the state flag, as well approving replica flags for commercial sale and other standards related to the flag.

The flag was officially adopted on March 5, 1923, and has been a symbol of the state of Washington since then. Washington had achieved statehood in 1889, but did not have an official flag at the time. The Washington chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution designed the flag in 1915 and campaigned for its adoption by the Washington State Legislature in the early 1920s. The state flag has undergone minor revisions since its adoption, including the use of standardized colors in 1955 and a modernized seal in 1967.</p>

        <p>Placeholder text.....The company started when the English food chemist Gustav Mellin developed an infant formula in 1866.[1] Mellin's formula was a simplified version of one which had been recently invented by the German chemist Justus von Liebig.[2] It wasn't a total nutritional supplement, the powder was diluted with cow's milk and water and was called a "milk modifier".[1] It was a "soluble, dry extract of wheat, malted barley and bicarbonate of potassium."[3] The formula was advertised with the slogan: "Mellin's Food for Infants and Invalids: The only perfect substitute for Mother's Milk".[4]


The "Mellin's Airship" being flown by Stanley Spencer in 1902.
In 1902, the Mellin Food Company sponsored the construction of the United Kingdom's first airship by Stanley Spencer. The completed airship carried an advertisement for Mellin's Food on its envelope. On 22 September 1902, Spencer flew the "Mellin's Airship" (officially named "Airship No 1") across London from Crystal Palace to Harrow.[5]</p>

            <p>Placeholder text....Early American currency went through several stages of development in colonial and post-Revolutionary history of the United States. Because few coins were minted in the thirteen colonies that became the United States in 1776, foreign coins like the Spanish dollar were widely circulated. Colonial governments sometimes issued paper money to facilitate economic activities. The British Parliament passed Currency Acts in 1751, 1764, and 1773 that regulated colonial paper money.</p>
